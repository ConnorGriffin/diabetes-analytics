# Diabetes Analysis

Data science on my personal diabetes data. 

I use Cronometer to track food intake, and Tandem t:connect with Control IQ for insulin data. 

Outside of the existing closed loop systems, it seems there is no way for 
an individual to merge food and insulin data. I aim to create a way to merge 
this data and analyze it to better tailor my pump settings.
